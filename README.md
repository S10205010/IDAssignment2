Carpe Diem is a one-stop website for users to see the weather forecast for the next 2 hours, 24 hours and 4 days to plan their activity. Carpe Diem also organise real-time data from APIs to let users decide the activity that they should do at that moment. Carpe Diem has a function that allows user to plan their activity for the day. Using information of where the activity held with weather forecast information, it will inform the user the weather at that place in that period of time.

## Design Process
 As a student, I want to plan to study at a comfortable location in the afternoon since exams are coming. I can use Carpe Diem to see the current air temperature and if the current temperature is going to be hot, I would head to library. If the 2 hour forecast states that it might be thundery showers, I might not want to go to the library.

 As a student, I have free time during the holidays and plans to head outside for some activity. I can use Carpe Diem to check current weather at the location or look at the 2 hour weather forecast to decide if I should head to that location.

 As a parent, I want to remind my children to take an umbrella. I can use Carpe Diem to look at the 24-hour weather forecast to advise my children to bring an umbrella.

 As a construction foreman, I have to plan the work schedule for my workers to meet the dateline of the construction project. I can use Carpe Diem to look at the 4 day weather forecast to see the next 4 days' weather. With Carpe Diem schedule feature, I can schedule my timeline on the website and receive up to date weather forecast change.

 As a person that is leaving the house for various purposes, I may want to check the weather to see if I should wear a mask if the PSI index is high or bringing an umbrella is necessary or taking a full bottle of water is important. Carpe Diem has real-time PSI index reading, real-time Air temperature reading, real-time rainfall reading to help the person to make his or her decision.
